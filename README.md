**Layout** - is a template (.ejs - file extension), which defines the following components:
* arrangement of widgets, 
* options for widget templates, 
* plugin to control the layout grid on the client (e.g. gridster), 
* connection of shared resources.

**Widget** - is an object that is located on the layout and interacts with the server via ajax-requests. 

Widgets may be static, or may have a link to go to the list of system objects. _Static widget_ display information in the form specified for the widget image, or in the form of statistical data on the system objects, calculated by the specified formulas or conditions for filters. While _widgets with a link to the list of objects_ - display information about the number of objects that match the conditions in this list. [Read more about widget setting](/docs/ru/layouts.md).

It's available on the control panel.

The following types of widgets are presented on the control panel:
